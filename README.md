# Tech Stack #
This is a Winform-UI project build using .Net Framewok and C# with MSSql as database.

# Campus-lost-and-found-system-C-
A C# application for managing lost and found items on campus. This system allows users to log, track, and reclaim lost items efficiently. It features item cataloging, secure storage tracking, and a user-friendly interface for reporting and claiming lost belongings. Ideal for campuses to streamline their lost and found process but this UI is more towards a Web like other than desktop.

# Working #
This only works for learning purposes as this will not ensure a complete distributional architecture like Web which we can access using internet but you can easily visualize how a campus lost and found system works.
